# Procedural Generation

For the moment this is just a basic implementation of marchings squares algorithm.
A tilemap is then created with simple fbx assets, perfect for a point and click game.
More features to come : modularity of terrain generation, world division into chunks, vegetation and poi generation, maybe biomes ?
